# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis (2020–2021)

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data from 2020 to 2021, highlighting infection rates, death trends, and population impact across countries and continents.  
Using an interactive Tableau dashboard, the project visualizes the global spread of the virus, mortality patterns, and how infection percentages changed month-to-month.

The goal is to provide a clear, data-driven understanding of how COVID-19 evolved over time and how different regions were affected.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies  
This project uses a combination of data extraction, cleaning, and visualization tools:

- **SQL**: Used to query, aggregate, and prepare COVID-19 case and death data.  
- **Excel**: Used for preprocessing, cleaning missing values, and organizing country/continent data.  
- **Tableau**: Built interactive dashboards showing KPIs, infection rates, continent-level deaths, and monthly trends.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Track global **total cases, total deaths, and death percentage**  
- Compare **percent of population infected** across countries  
- Analyze **COVID-19 deaths by continent**  
- Measure the **average monthly infection rate** globally  
- Visualize how the pandemic evolved across 2020–2021

## 🔍 Process / Methodology  

### **1. Data Cleaning**
- Removed duplicates  
- Standardized country and continent names  
- Filled or handled missing population values  
- Ensured date fields were consistent for monthly analysis  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Explored COVID-19 patterns across:
- Countries  
- Continents  
- Monthly time periods  
- Population sizes  

### **3. Dashboard Development (Tableau)**  
Designed an interactive dashboard featuring:
- Global KPIs (cases, deaths, death percentage)  
- Heatmap of infection percentage per country  
- Bar chart of deaths by continent  
- Monthly trend of average population infection percentage  
- Filters for country, continent, and year  

---

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Some countries experienced extremely high infection percentages compared to their population sizes.  
- Certain continents recorded significantly higher total deaths due to population size, reporting structure, or outbreak severity.  
- The infection rate fluctuated month-to-month, with noticeable spikes during major global waves.  
- Death percentages varied widely between countries, suggesting differences in healthcare capacity, reporting accuracy, and outbreak control strategies.

## 🧭 Observations  
(Not business recommendations — more scientific/analytical observations.)

### **1. Infection Spread Was Uneven Across Countries**  
Some countries had much higher infection percentages, indicating:  
- Higher testing/reporting  
- Denser populations  
- Larger outbreaks  

### **2. Continent-Level Deaths Were Highly Concentrated**  
A few continents accounted for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, correlating with population size and outbreak scale.

### **3. Monthly Infection Rates Show Clear Pandemic Waves**  
The average percentage of the population infected per month reveals distinct global waves across 2020 and 2021.

### **4. Death Percentage Shows Healthcare Impact**  
Countries with higher death percentages may have:  
- Limited medical resources  
- Late outbreak detection  
- Strain on hospital capacity
